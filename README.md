<h1>Face Recognition Project</h1>

A real-time Face Detection and Recognition system built using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy.
This project captures face data through your webcam, trains the model on that data, and recognizes faces live.

<h1>Features</h1>

* Real-time face detection using OpenCV
* Face data collection and storage for training
* Face recognition from webcam feed
* Simple and lightweight — runs on most systems
* Option to quit anytime using the ‘q’ key

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (cv2)
* NumPy

<h1>Setup Instructions</h1>
<h3>1️. Install Dependencies</h3>

Open terminal and run:

pip install opencv-python numpy

<h3>2️. Test  Webcam</h3>

Check if webcam is working correctly:

python video_read.py

<h3>3️. Collect Face Data</h3>

Capture  face data and store it for recognition:

python face_data.py

<h3>4️. Test Face Detection</h3>

Verify that system detects faces properly:

python face_detection.py

<h3>5️. Run Face Recognition</h3>

Start recognizing faces in real-time:

python face_recognition.py

<h3>6️. Exit the Program</h3>

Press the ‘q’ key to safely close the window.
